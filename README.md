#### The goal of this project is to make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road. Either images or video can be input to test the pipeline. The project is done in [Python with OpenCV](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/basics-jupyter-notebook-and-python) library and can be opened in [Jupyter Notebook](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python).
